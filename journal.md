### Dec 20, 2015

I started a rudimentary, software-only piano tuner experiment.

### Dec 21, 2015

Abandoned the software experiment.

### July 4, 2019

I hack together some notes for a possible hardware implementation of a piano
tuner, thinking about:

- Needles for octave, note in octave, tuning in note, volume
- Lamp for power
- Lamps behind needle dials
- Capacitive fade-in for lamps
- Glass or plastic bead in front of power lamp
- Phonograph-style mic pickup
- Clock hands for needles

Initially I assume it'll run a Fast Fourier Transform, and toy with the idea
of using a 
[Texas Instruments LEA](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa720/slaa720.pdf)
(Low-Energy Accelerator). That would be good if we're making 10,000 of these
things, but it would be a steep learning curve.

All of this goes into a Google Doc and then somewhat forgotten about.

### Sept 26, 2020

I found an antique-style wooden box on Facebook Marketplace. It's pretty
clearly one-of-a-kind, and was hand-made in an Egyptian workshop by a late 
relative of the seller. It's perfect.

In around now, plotting starts to solidify for a hardware tuner.

### Sept 28, 2020

Wife orders 
[copper foil](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0042SWYUA) 
for the horn. I order the 
[USB microphone](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07VWJ1XB2) 
that will be connected to the Raspberry Pi 4 I have on hand.

### Sept 29, 2020

Orders for more power accessories:
[5V 25W power supply](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00DECXUD0), 
and a nice little 
[USB-C-to-terminal-block power adapter](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07R8YPFD7)
to power the Pi without having to jankily connect a cell phone charger on the
inside of the enclosure.

Ordered a handful of gauges, 5Vdc analogue, of various sizes:

[45mm](https://www.ebay.ca/itm/181981812727),
[66mm](https://www.ebay.ca/itm/183445575857)
and
[90mm](https://www.ebay.ca/itm/172695600128).

These are coming from China so I'm expecting it to take forever for them to 
get here, but anything in North America is exhorbitant. The intent is to 
replace the faceplate with a custom one and backlight it if possible.

Order some vintage-style electrical accessories from 
[Vintage Wire & Supply](https://vintagewireandsupply.com). They're relatively
expensive but look incredible.

Pictured above: temporary keyboard on the bottom; open box (so far unmodified) 
in the middle with the Raspberry Pi board sitting on top of it; USB microphone 
sticking out to the right. The ribbon cable is for a real-time clock that is 
also temporary. On the left you can see the twisted brown cotton vintage-style 
120VAC cord.

Pictured above: power components sitting in a temporary arrangement in the box. 
Far centre left is the brown 120VAC cord, running to a brass stress relief in 
the middle that will eventually be in the side of the box. Centre is a white 
marette to the switch. Lower left is the antique switch that will be mounted to 
the exterior of the box. Lower right is the MeanWell power supply; more rugged 
and well-ventilated than the typical cell phone charger. The red-yellow cord 
runs 5V from the power supply to a small green terminal block, in turn through a 
USB-C cable to the Raspberry Pi on the upper left.

### Oct 2, 2020

Going on vacation. The wife has let me bring a pile of tech goodies to work on 
this project.

### Oct 3, 2020

Using the same GitHub web page, resuscitate the tuner project, but with 
hardware in mind. The Raspberry Pi, keyboard, mouse, microphone and cell phone
power supply are set up on the coffee table of the cottage, and I have a great
time getting going on development.

### Oct 4, 2020

Start using the Simple Direct Layer for microphone capture on the Raspberry Pi.
Pretty much immediately throw that out the window in favour of the underlying
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.

### Oct 7, 2020

Research into the best way to detect pitch. Intend on running autocorrelation 
for note detection, in line with the
[findings of Coert Vonk](https://coertvonk.com/sw/embedded/arduino-pitch-detector-13252),
and associated research by
[Brown](http://academics.wellesley.edu/Physics/brown/pubs/acptrv89P2346-P2354.pdf)
and
[Monti](http://193.166.3.2/pub/sci/audio/dafx/2000/profs.sci.univr.it/%257Edafx/Final-Papers/pdf/Monti_DAFX00poster.pdf).

Some of it makes no sense to me so I post on a 
[Digital Signal Processing](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/70736)
forum.

Ordered some Microchip PIC16LF1773 (programmable interrupt controller) from 
Mouser, since DigiKey was nearly out of stock. These devices have a mix of 5- 
and 10-bit unbuffered DACs that can be internally buffered with three op-amps; 
they also support UART, I2C and SPI - so one way or the other they'll 
definitely be able to talk with the Pi.

### Oct 10, 2020

Start using the Gnu Scientific Library with the intent of applying it to the 
autocorrelation work.

### Oct 11, 2020

Throw GSL out the window in favour of ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra 
Software), an implementation of BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms).

### Oct 16, 2020

The gauges arrived from China, quicker than I expected! They're wonderful
little devices, fully disassemble-able with two screws on the side, and come
pre-packaged with hardware for the mounting bolts. There's a high-accuracy
resistor in each, and the input impedance is a little over 5k, so the PIC can
definitely handle it.

![Gauge sitting on a breadboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/gauge-on-board.jpg)

Upper left: chassis of the power supply; with the red PICkit 3 programmer in 
front of it, plugged into the breadboard.

The breadboard has the intended DAC PIC just below the PICkit.

On the gauge itself: the sticker on the top will be discarded; the front 
plastic pane and surrounding cylindrical cover come off with two screws on the 
side (not shown); then the instrument plate comes off with two bolts on the 
front.

### Oct 19, 2020

Start a PIC firmware project to act as a DAC (digital-to-analogue converter) 
for the Raspberry Pi.

### Oct 21, 2020

Start an Eagle schematic to plan out how the DAC will be connected.

### Oct 22, 2020

Parts I still need to dig up or buy:

- Amber LEDs for the gauge backlights
- Perfboard
- Rectangular cable to run from the Pi to header on the perfboard
- A rail-to-rail 0-5V buffer op-amp for the one remaining unbuffered DAC output

I also need to upgrade the Pi to a 64-bit operating system, since I didn't 
realize I had been using a deprecated 32-bit Raspbian.

Also need to write a calibration routine that gives me interquartile range for
the harmonics at various notes.

### Oct 23, 2020

Consider using a nice amber LED for backlights; such as the Lite-On LTL-1CHA with
- 3mm diffusion lens
- 20mA max, 2.1 volts forward
- 60¬∞ half-power angle
- Wavelengths: 602 nanometres dominant, 610 nanometres peak

If we use 10mA, we need 270R limiting each LED. For fade-in with a capacitor 
parallel to the LED, and a time constant over 2 seconds, we need a large 
capacitor of ~10mF.

### Oct 24, 2020

The capacitive fade-in option kind of sucks. The capacitors needed are big and 
expensive, and all four could be replaced with a single 40mA MOSFET driven by
PWM from the PIC. Another advantage of PWM would be that it works right away,
where as capacitive charge has to go through a dead zone where the forward 
voltage is below that needed by the LED.

The PIC16F1773 supports 10/16-bit hardware PWM with a bunch of different 
sources. PWMs 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 11 all support PPS and at least one of them can
output to each of PORTA/B/C, respectively. Compare/capture/PWM (CCP) modules
1, 2, and 7 likewise can output to at least one of those ports.

The hardware solution would have charged by

    V(t) Œ± 1 - exp(-t/ùúè)
    
with 90% by

    t = -ùúè ln(1 - 0.9)

If we want 90% in two seconds, ùúè ~ 0.8686, and our time expression becomes

    V(t) Œ± 1 - 0.1^(t/2)

A piecewise linear approximation would depend on the derivative:

    dV/dt = 1/ùúè exp(-t/ùúè)
          = -ln0.1 / 2 * 0.1^(t/2)
    
If we increment 8 of the 16 bits in the duty cycle for a PWM,
the configuration would be

    EN = 1
    MODE = 00 (standard)
    PRIE = 1 (interrupt on period match to update duty)
    PS set to divide between 2^0 and 2^7
    CS either HFINTOSC (16MHz) or LFINTOSC (31kHz) - both sleep-compatible
    OFM = 00 (independent run)

We will be starting DC at 0, DC delta at a high value, and applying a simple
binary exponential decay algorithm on the delta. To find the initial delta
value we need to work backward: at the end of the curve, the delta will only
be 1, representing 2^-8 of full deflection. The last intersection of the exact
and approximate curves is at

    -ùúè ln(2^-8) ~ 4.817 s
    
At this time, the derivative is

    1/ùúè * 2^-8 ~ 0.004497

The time it takes to increase 2^-8 is, with an initial tangent,

    2^-8 ùúè exp(t/ùúè)

which starts as 3.4 ms. If we only did this for one cycle, we could still have
a PWM rate of 295 Hz. Assuming a PR of 0x100, 

    Period = (PWMxPR + 1) * prescale / clock
    prescale = log(16e6 * 2^-8 ùúè / (2^8 + 1)) / log(2) ~ 7.72 > 7

The slowest prescale for 16-bit PWM is 2^7, which would mean a period value of

    2^-8 ùúè * 16e6 / 2^7 - 1 ~ 423 > 2^8

which would require carry operations during PWM update. If we go the other way,
disable the prescaler and use LFINTOSC=31kHz,

    2^-8 ùúè * 31e3 - 1 = 104

`TMR2IE` probably won't work in 10-bit mode, because the timer is cleared on
period match.

It's also worth noting that the transfer function for duty cycle to lumens is 
assumed to be linear but probably isn't.


### Oct 25, 2020

Some of the above will stay true and some won't. The problem with having a
fixed delta update rate is that eventually, the delta would need to be
fractional, and we're only using integer math.

This is a very powerful device; we could pursue any of the following as
alternatives:

- Use 16-bit PWM, interrupt on `PRIF`, increment a soft post-scaler,
  increment `PWMxDC` on post-scale overflow, double post-scale factor every
  140 `PRIF`s
- Use 10/16-bit PWM, short `PWMx` output to `TMR4_clk` input, increment 
  `PWMxDCH` on every `TMR4IF`, short `PWMx` output to `TMR6_clk` input, double 
  `PR4` on every `TMR6IF`
- Use CLC with two internal PWM/CCP inputs, offset by a beat frequency
- Use COG with two internal PCM/CCP inputs, offset by a beat frequency

For the last one, we'd have:

- `COG1CON0`
    - `EN` = 1
    - `CS` = 0b10 (HFINTOSC, sleep-compatible)
    - `MD` = 0b000 (steered PWM)
- `G1RIS9` = 1 (PWM5 for rising)
- `G1FIS10` = 1 (PWM6 for falling)
- `COG1STRA` = 1 (output on steering channel A)

### Oct 27, 2020

Continuing the silliness above, I've posted a 
[detailed solution](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/529533/10008).

### Nov 24, 2020

A month, more math and experimentation later, the LED fader is done. As it turns 
out, the luminosity transfer function seems to be visually exponential so I can 
get away with a linear ramp. 

![bright LED](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/led-fading.jpg)

The very bright red LED used in this test will not be used in the final system 
but is working fine nevertheless. This one is so bright that it illuminates my 
ceiling at 20mA.

### Nov 25, 2020

New parts ordered: 

- the protoboard where stuff will get soldered (though-hole only), 
- the nice amber LEDs, 
- some rectangular cables for SPI, and 
- some rail-to-rail operational amplifiers - only one is needed as a buffer for 
  a digital-to-analog converter output; the other outputs have buffers already.

### Nov 26, 2020

Did a rough layout of the digital-to-analog converter circuit as it will be on
the protoboard.

![Eagle protoboard layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/protoboard-eagle.png)

- Upper left: the power entry block
- Mid-left: the buffer chip "U2" for gauges. Only one of the two channels is 
  strictly necessary, but use both to offload a tiny bit more current from the 
  MCU and prevent floating.
- Centre: the MCU (microcontroller) "U1" that the Raspberry Pi will talk to, 
  with its SPI (serial port) "JS" on the bottom.
- Lower-right: gauge backlight PWM driving circuit, four-channel
- Upper-right: programming/debug connector "JD".

The red traces are copper on the board's top layer. The thin yellow lines are
ratsnest that I need to wire and solder myself.

### Nov 30, 2020

This `efind` script shows that it's possible to null a fixed, positive offset 
voltage on the MCP6002 operational amplifier I use for DAC buffering.

```python
    Vdd = 5
    Voff = 4.5e-3
    R2 = 0

    def find_r4(R6: float, R5: float, R1: float) -> float:
        return (R5/R6 + 1) * R1 * Voff/Vdd

    def find_r3(R6: float, R5: float, R1: float, R4: float):
        R4R3 = R5/R6 - R4/R1
        if R4R3 == 0:
            return float('inf')
        return R4 / R4R3

    def find_vo(Vi: float, R6: float, R5: float, R1: float, R4: float, R3: float) -> float:
        Vin = Vi*R6/(R6 + R5) + Voff
        I3 = Vin/(R2 + R3)
        I1 = (Vdd - Vin)/R1
        I4 = I3 - I1
        Vo = Vin + R4*I4
        return Vo

    s = Solver(
        (
            Resistor('6', E24, None, 1e6, 10e6),
            Resistor('5', E96, None, 1e3, 10e3),
            Resistor('1', E96, None, 1e6, 10e6),
            Resistor('4', E96, find_r4),
            Resistor('3', E96, find_r3),
        ),
        (
            Output(
                'Vol', 'V', 0,
                partial(find_vo, 0),
            ),
            Output(
                'Voh', 'V', Vdd,
                partial(find_vo, 5),
            ),
        ),
        1e-5,
    )
    s.solve()
    s.print()
```

It outputs:

```
    R6      R5      R1      R4      R3        Vol      Err        Voh      Err

```

But I won't actually do this nulling, for reasons listed
[here](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/534855).

### December 4, 2020

When my brothers play Path of Exile with me, they have taken to calling its
[crafting workbench](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Crafting_Bench) "[my]
actual workbench" due to its electrified animations. Currently, on the first
day of my latest vacation, my mobile workbench looks like this:

![Breadboard connected](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/breadboard-connected.jpg)

This marks the first time that the breadboard is connected to the Pi via a 
4-conductor wire carrying SPI. The SPI microcontroller firmware was written
last weekend but hasn't been tested yet. The buffer op-amp is connected and
initial gauge tests work. The gauge input posts are left-negative, right-
positive when looking from the front.

I've also (finally) started using a 64-bit OS for the Raspberry Pi 4.

Next is to:

- based on the 
  [documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/spi/README.md#software),
  put the SPI module in 8-bit, `SPI_NO_CS` mode
- work off of the Raspberry Pi/Linux
  [SPI test code](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-5.4.y/tools/spi/spidev_test.c)
  
### December 5, 2020
  
If I end up adding a back-illuminated bead for power indication (which now
seems a little redundant to me given that the gauges are already illuminated
on power), one option if I can't find anything better is this thing from
Michael's:

- Item [10402037](https://canada.michaels.com/en/bead-gallery-crystal-faceted-glass-round-beads-18mm/10402037.html)
- 18mm diameter faceted glass
- It's labelled "crystal", though I don't know how far to trust that
  
A very attractive option from the Bead Boutique is their
[quartz "nuggets"](https://thebeadboutiqueon.com/products/22x15mm-faceted-quartz-nugget-beads):

- Natural clear quartz
- 22x15mm "medium focal" size

As for gauge illumination, the LTL-1CHA is way (way, *way*) too dim to be
useful for backlighting. On the next DigiKey order I'll be switching to high-
brightness amber LEDs from Cree. Looking at the gauge interior again, it does
look like a LED mounted at the inner rear of the gauge would need an eyeballed
30 degrees to either side, or 60 degrees total, without some other diffusion
scheme.

### December 12, 2020

The woodworking portion began. I sought some external expertise from my parents
about the best way to cut circular holes for the gauges. I had started with a
drill and then (massive) reciprocating saw, not realizing that we have a jigsaw
("autoscroller") better-suited to the job. All of the gauge holes were then done
by drill, jigsaw, and then dremel sanding to creep up to a snug fit.

The first (gnarly) cuts:

![First cut](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/first-cut.jpg)

This was time-consuming but straightforward. The rear power intake stress relief
was also straightforward. The power indicator was especially lucky: the quartz
teardrop, on its end, fits very well into a hole made by a standard drillbit and
is so snug that it probably won't require glue.

The biggest problem was the power switch. The threaded shaft was too short
compared to the thickness of the wood. A fancy solution would be to recess the
front plate, but I'm not good enough to do that and anyway it wouldn't look as
good as the alternative: ablate a hole for the switch body on the inside of the
box. Given that the box is already assembled and I refuse to disassemble it,
this was a huge pain in the ass and required many passes with an awkwardly-
angled dremel. I got it down to the point where there was barely enough thread
protruding for the front finishing nut to grab, and: good enough.

![First assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/first-assembly.jpg)

To do:

- Still need at least one more hole, for the microphone and/or the horn neck
- The wire cleats still need to be attached to the back
- Replacement gauge backlights ordered and installed
- Power indicator dimmed (330R is way too bright) and LED somehow mounted
- Ideally brass screws installed for all gauges
- Maybe re-sand and stain surface? Or leave it looking beat up.

# December 13, 2020

For gauge fastening nuts, they need to be #4-40 (slightly less than 1/8"
diameter shaft),  slightly less than 1/4" diameter head, and at least 3/4" long
if a nut is to be applied on the inside. McMaster-Carr carries
[brass bolts](https://www.mcmaster.com/92443A841/) that would do the job but
apparently some family members have equivalents in stock, so I won't place an
order. (I also considered Acklands-Grainger but it seems that they aren't
shipping anything until the end of January.)

# December 17, 2020

Working moving gauge demo end-to-end. Also, the new backlights are in, and have
a very nice hue and what will certainly be enough brightness. I'm worried about
how narrow the light cone is, but I'll deal with that with a secondary diffuser
if I have to.

# December 19, 2020

Wire cleats, power supply, strain relief and power indicator light all mounted.

![Wire cleats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/cleats.jpg)

![Mounted power supply](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/mounted-psu.jpg)

The power indicator looks fine with a little over 1mA from a 2.2k resistor. By
contrast, the backlights will need to be fairly bright, close to the
recommended maximum drive current of 30mA through 38 ohms. That resistor had to
be approximated from a parallel 51 and 150 because it's what I have on hand and
doesn't merit a new parts order. With this 38 ohms, the current is shared with
two LEDs in series, which doubles the drive efficiency and allows us to drop
the drive FET - since 60mA is easily within the 100mA tolerated by the PIC's
high-drive mode. In addition to high-drive mode, the PIC port can be put in
open-drain mode (though I found a bug in the Microchip vendor header where some
registers are misnamed or missing, but there's an easy workaround).

Today we started cutting gauge faceplate plastic out of a recycled salad
container. Paper will be glued to the front of these.

# December 20, 2020

Soldering almost done, save some LED wires:

![Soldered board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/solder.jpg)

I don't like soldering very much, and I'm not great at it, but the board works 
(at least for the PIC and the power LED fade, so far).

# December 22, 2020

Most of the gauge art is done in Gimp. I'm working in 600 DPI, and trying to carefully preserve radial accuracy while substituting gauge scale graphics. Only missing is the decibel scale.

![Gauge art](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/gauges.jpg)

More family help has come in the form of math to accurately identify frequencies:

![Audio math](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/math.jpg)

# December 30, 2020

Well, it's been gifted - though it isn't done yet, and I imagine will continue 
to be a labour of love for some time, particularly in software refinement.

Even more family help arrived in the form of pinning down some
[pesky circuit issues](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/539329) 
with a backlight and a gauge. Those seem to have stabilised, so we can finally
focus on the software in more detail.

![Backlit on the bench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/bench.jpg)

As I feared, the light cone is indeed both too sharp and narrow from the LEDs
compared to what I would have preferred, so if I'm feeling extra ambitious or
bored and want to de-solder and de-glue the existing LEDs, I would replace them
with fancy oval ones that have wider viewing angle; or add some diffusion
material.

# April 29, 2021

We're now in the "long tail" of refinements. One of the trickiest bits - fixing
up a gauge winding that was tangled, trimming some gauge surfaces that were
rubbing, and general finagling was needed to get the gauges to move reliably,
and my family was instrumental in getting that done.

Other family help came in the form of a brilliant idea for the diffusion problem
- simply rough up the LED lenses. This does exactly what it should:

![Backlit and diffused](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reinderien/pianotuner/master/journal-pics/backlights.jpg)

There's a pesky and difficult-to-reproduce microcontroller hang that we might
eventually be able to solve, but in the meantime we're converging on something
that actually works.
